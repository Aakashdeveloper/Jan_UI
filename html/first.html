        <p>Angular creates it, renders it, creates and renders its children, checks it when its data-bound properties change, and destroys it before removing it from the DOM.

            Angular offers lifecycle hooks that provide visibility into these key life moments and the ability to act when they occur.

                11111Directive and component instances have a lifecycle as Angular creates, updates, and destroys them. Developers can tap into key moments in that lifecycle by implementing one or 
                more of the lifecycle hook interfaces
                in the Angular core library.
                Each interface has a single hook method 
                whose name is the interface name prefixed 
                with ng. For example, the OnInit interface has a hook method named ngOnInit() that Angular calls shortly after creating the component:
